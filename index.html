		<h2>Happy 20th Monthsary!</h2>
	
		<br><p>We've been apart for a year, and I can't tell you how much I miss you.<br>
			You are the only thing that comes to my mind every day.<br>
			When I sleep I always hug my pillow and I am thinking that it was you.<br> 
			Every time we fight, I miss you even more.<br>
			I know when we fight, I don't comfort you but this is all I can say I love you.<br>
			Once you arrive home.<br>
			I will hug you tightly, kiss you on your sweet lips and show you how much I love you.</p>
